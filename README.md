Install scripts and instructions

These files explains how to make a Moodle installation on Ubuntu 16.04,
with the necessary trimmings to use the KQMATH plugin.

1.  We use a standard NTNU/IIR image which includes Ubuntu 16.04 with
  PostgreSQL and Docker.  (We do not expect to need Docker, but we will
  use PostgreSQL.)

2.  Install dependencies (assuming postgresql is already installed).

   sudo apt-get install maxima gnuplot apache2 php php-pear phppgadmin

3.
